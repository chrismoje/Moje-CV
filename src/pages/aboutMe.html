        <img src="/images/chris_moje_selfie.jpg" alt="chris moje headshot"></img>
        <p>Hi I am Chris Moje, a result driven Electronics and a practicing Electrical Engineer with more than 17 years of comprehensive training and experience in an Oil and Gas Contractor firm serving the need for a continuous and smooth operations of machines and equipment utilized in maintenance of oil platforms and rigs. 
        I have a wide knowledge on electronic and electrical controls, industrial automation practices, electrical facility design, Instrumentation and Calibrations, power generation and distributions, HVAC, pneumatic and hydraulic applications. I am currently working in Angola having a work shift of 10-weeks ON and 8-weeks OFF.</p>
       
        <br>
        <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
        <p>I love to order project stuffs from online stores and have it "DIY" once I am home. Most of the DIY projects I made are Arduino & Raspberry Pi-Based Robots. Recently,
            I found myself being interested on image detection programming. Aside from Electronics, I am also into Motorcycles, I love to setup my bike, ride with my friends, and sight seeing. Also worth to include on my list is my love for watching UFO documentary series.
